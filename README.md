# Lox-Interpreter
This project is part of the Compiler Construction course, in this project I build the **Lox** interpreter using **Java** programming language with the help of the **Crafting Interpreters** book to learn how to build interpreters.<br>
**Book**: [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html)<br>
*I would like to thank the book's author for his magnificent work on that book*.
